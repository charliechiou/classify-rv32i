#### The following will describe the purpose and function of each component :

## ReLu ( Rectified Linear Unit )

### Introduction

To enable our model to learn more complex relationships within the data, we implemented the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function.  

```math
f(x) = max(0, x)
```

If the input value is less than 0, the output is set to 0. If the input value is greater than or equal to 0, the output equals the input.  

### Methodology
Using the `bnez` instruction to check whether there are still element need to be handle and employed `bltz` to check whether each element is less than zero.

```
loop_start:
    ...
    bltz t1,set_zero
    ...
store_element:
    addi a0, a0, 4 # move pointer to next element
    addi a1, a1, -1 # decrease the number of remain element
    bnez a1, loop_start
end:
```

If so, jump to `set_zero` and set the value to zero.

```
set_zero:
    li t1, 0 #set element to zero
```
## Argmax

### Introduction
By using the argmax function, we can find the index of the largest value in the output. This index corresponds to the predicted class, allowing us to determine the model's prediction.
### Methodology
Setting the first element as the initial maximum value

```
    lw t1, 0(a0)        # t1 store the initial current max value
    li t2, 0            # t2 store max value index
```

 use the `blt` instruction to loop through the input. 
 
```
loop_start:
    ...
    j next_element
    ...

next_element:
    addi t3, t3, 1 
    blt t3,a1,loop_start
```

 If an element is larger than the current maximum stored in `t2`, the program jumps to the `update_max` label, where the maximum value and its index are updated.

 ```
    blt t1, t4, update_max  #If current max smaller than current element then branch
update_max:
    mv t1, t4  #update current max value
    mv t2, t3  #update current max value index
 ```

## Dot product

### Introduction
The dot product operation requires two input vectors of equal length, multiplying them element by element. In this project, we need to use the `dot` function to perform matrix multiplication.

### Methodology
First, ensure that all inputs are valid (i.e., all are positive).

```
    li t0, 1
    blt a2, t0, error_terminate  
    blt a3, t0, error_terminate   
    blt a4, t0, error_terminate  
```

The loop runs `a2` times to process each element in the input arrays.

```
loop_start:
    bge a6, a2, loop_end
    ...
    addi a6,a6,1
    j loop_start

loop_end:
```

Each element, based on the current index, is multiplied using bitwise operations.

```
mul:
    li t2,0

mul_loop_start:
    beq t1,x0,mul_loop_end
    andi t3,t1,1
    beq t3,x0,mul_skip
    add t2,t2,t0

mul_skip:
    slli t0,t0,1
    srli t1,t1,1
    j mul_loop_start

mul_loop_end:
```

The result of each multiplication `t2` is accumulated into `a7`.

```
    add a7,a7,t2
```

## Matrix Multiplication

### Introduction
For matric multiplicationï¼Œit is important to handling the stride.When multiply A and B, we have to dot product the **row** of A and **column** of B to get the element of output C.Therefore, the stride of A will be `1` and the stride of B will be `the column number of B`.

### Methodology
First, ensure that all inputs are valid (i.e., all values are positive).

```
    li t0 1
    blt a1, t0, error
    blt a2, t0, error
    blt a4, t0, error
    blt a5, t0, error
    bne a2, a4, error
```

This process is similar to the dot product calculation, but with two loops to iterate through each **row of matrix A** and each **column of matrix B**.

```
outer_loop_start:
    li s1, 0 #reset inner loop counter
    ...
    blt s0, a1, inner_loop_start

    j outer_loop_end
    
inner_loop_start:
    beq s1, a5, inner_loop_end
    ...
    addi s1, s1, 1
    j inner_loop_start
    
inner_loop_end:
    ...
    addi s0,s0,1
    j outer_loop_start       # repeat outer loop

outer_loop_end:
```

The outer loop uses `s0` as a counter to track the current row of A. After confirming that there are rows left to process (i.e., `s0` < `a1`), it proceeds to the inner loop.

In the inner loop, pointers are set to the beginning of the current row of A and the current column of B. The appropriate stride values are configured, and then the dot function is called to calculate and store the resulting element in matrix C.

```
    addi sp, sp, -24
    sw a0, 0(sp)
    sw a1, 4(sp)
    sw a2, 8(sp)
    sw a3, 12(sp)
    sw a4, 16(sp)
    sw a5, 20(sp)
    
    mv a0, s3 # setting pointer for matrix A into the correct argument value
    mv a1, s4 # setting pointer for Matrix B into the correct argument value
    mv a2, a2 # setting the number of elements to use to the columns of A
    li a3, 1 # stride for matrix A
    mv a4, a5 # stride for matrix B
    
    jal dot
    
    mv t0, a0 # storing result of the dot product into t0
    
    lw a0, 0(sp)
    lw a1, 4(sp)
    lw a2, 8(sp)
    lw a3, 12(sp)
    lw a4, 16(sp)
    lw a5, 20(sp)
    addi sp, sp, 24
```

## Read Matrix

### Introduction
To load pretrained MNIST weights, we need to implement a function that reads matrix data from a binary file. This function dynamically allocate memory and retrieve the matrix dimensions from the file header.

### Methodology
Using the `fopen` function in `util.s`, we can obtain the file descriptor of the binary file. 

```
fopen:
    mv a2 a1
    mv a1 a0
    li a0 c_openFile
    ecall
    #FOPEN_RETURN_HOOK
    jr ra
```

To read the file contents, we use the `fread` function. 

```
fread:
    mv a3 a2
    mv a2 a1
    mv a1 a0
    li a0 c_readFile
    ecall
    #FREAD_RETURN_HOOK
    jr ra
```

First, we read the number of rows and columns from the file header, 

```
    lw t1, 28(sp)    # opening to save num rows
    lw t2, 32(sp)    # opening to save num cols

    sw t1, 0(s3)     # saves num rows
    sw t2, 0(s4)     # saves num cols
```

then calculate the matrix size by multiplying these values.

```
mul:
    li s1,0

mul_loop_start:
    beq t2,x0,mul_loop_end
    andi t3,t2,1
    beq t3,x0,mul_skip
    add s1,s1,t1

mul_skip:
    slli t1,t1,1
    srli t2,t2,1
    j mul_loop_start

mul_loop_end:
```

Following that, we use the same approach to read each element of the matrix into memory.

```
    # set up file, buffer and bytes to read
    mv s2, a0        # matrix
    mv a0, s0
    mv a1, s2
    lw a2, 24(sp)

    jal fread
```

## Write Matrix

### Introduction
After calculating the result, we need to write it back to the binary file. The `write_matrix` function first write the matrix dimensions as the header, then allocate memory to store the result, and finally write each matrix element into the file.

### Methodology
Similar to reading the matrix, first open the file to obtain the file descriptor.

```
fopen:
    mv a2 a1
    mv a1 a0
    li a0 c_openFile
    ecall
    #FOPEN_RETURN_HOOK
    jr ra
```

Then, use `fwrite` to write the matrix dimensions as the header. 

```
fwrite:
    mv a4 a3
    mv a3 a2
    mv a2 a1
    mv a1 a0
    li a0 c_writeFile
    ecall
    #FWRITE_RETURN_HOOK
    jr ra
```

By multiplying the rows and columns, we can determine the matrix size. 

```
mul:
    li s4,0

mul_loop_start:
    beq s3,x0,mul_loop_end
    andi t3,s3,1
    beq t3,x0,mul_skip
    add s4,s4,s2

mul_skip:
    slli s2,s2,1
    srli s3,s3,1
    j mul_loop_start

mul_loop_end:
```

Using the same approach of `fwrite`, write each element of the matrix into the file.

+ write the matrix dimension

```
    mv a0, s0
    addi a1, sp, 24  # buffer with rows and columns
    li a2, 2         # number of elements to write
    li a3, 4         # size of each element

    jal fwrite
```

+ write the matrix
```
    mv a0, s0
    mv a1, s1        # matrix data pointer
    mv a2, s4        # number of elements to write
    li a3, 4         # size of each element

    jal fwrite
```
