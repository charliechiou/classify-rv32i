# Assignment 2: Classify
 The project utilizes **RISC-V assembly language** to perform
 inference on a **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** by using pre-trained weights provided by instructor. To overcame the challenge, there are two part need to complete :

 ### Part A : Mathematical Functions  
Implement essential matrix operations critical for neural network inference, including:  
+ **ReLu ( Rectified Linear Unit )** : Activation function to filter out negative values within the matrix.  
+ **ArgMax** : Find out the index of the maximum value in a matrix.
+ **Dot Product** : Calculate the dot product of two vextors.
+ **Matrix Multiplication** : Calculate the multiplication of two matrixs to support the data flow between two matrices.

 ### Part B : File Operations
 Implement some essential file operation including:  
 + **Read Matrix** : Read matrix data from file for the network.
 + **Write Matrix** : Writes matrix data to file to save the results.  
   
     
The following will describe the purpose and function of each component :  

## ReLu ( Rectified Linear Unit )
To enable our model to learn more complex relationships within the data, we implemented the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function.  
`f(x) = max(0, x)`
If the input value is less than 0, the output is set to 0. If the input value is greater than or equal to 0, the output equals the input.  
### Methodology
I used the `bnez` instruction to iterate through the input vector and employed `bltz` to check whether each element is less than zero. If so, jump to `set_zero` and set the value to zero.

## Argmax
By using the argmax function, we can find the index of the largest value in the output. This index corresponds to the predicted class, allowing us to determine the model's prediction.
### Methodology
Setting the first element as the initial maximum value and use the `blt` instruction to loop through the input. If an element is larger than the current maximum stored in `t2`, the program jumps to the `update_max` label, where the maximum value and its index are updated.

## Dot product
The dot product operation requires two input vectors of equal length, multiplying them element by element. In this project, we need to use the `dot` function to perform matrix multiplication.

### Methodology
First, ensure that all inputs are valid (i.e., all are positive).
The loop runs a2 times to process each element in the input arrays.
Each element, based on the current index, is multiplied using bitwise operations.
The result of each multiplication (t2) is accumulated into a7.

## Matrix Multiplication
For matric multiplicationï¼Œit is important to handling the stride.When multiply A and B, we have to dot product the **row** of A and **column** of B to get the element of output C.Therefore, the stride of A will be `1` and the stride of B will be `the column number of B`.

### Methodology
First, ensure that all inputs are valid (i.e., all values are positive).
This process is similar to the dot product calculation, but with two loops to iterate through each **row of matrix A** and each **column of matrix B**.

The outer loop uses `s0` as a counter to track the current row of A. After confirming that there are rows left to process (i.e., `s0` < `a1`), it proceeds to the inner loop.

In the inner loop, pointers are set to the beginning of the current row of A and the current column of B. The appropriate stride values are configured, and then the dot function is called to calculate and store the resulting element in matrix C.
